Hi 👋! I’m Jose,

I’m interested in FrontEnd development, UI/UX, and anything that looks funny and interesting. Apart from coding, I really love reading about history, politics, theology and stuff. Also, love watching movies and doing excersise to keep the body shinny :P. Currently making myselft improved in many skills, but always learning new stuff to keep me busy. Usually, I work more on React projects, but any other new experience is always well received.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that has the purpose to make others life better.

You can reach me out by email: jafb727@gmail.com or Instagram: @jafb727.
